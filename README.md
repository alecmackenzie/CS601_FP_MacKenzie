CS601 Final Project - Personal Website

This is a personal website that I built using HTML, CSS, JS and Vue. 
THe goal is to continue to build on to this one or to use this wesbite 
as a stepping stone for more complex sites. 

This is a single page website that use anchors to jump to certain sections of the page 
with the use of the side navigation bar on the left side. All of the HTML can be found
in the index.html file. While I tried to make as much of my website interactive, time 
constraints and knowledge held me back on some aspects. The Navbar, the Education section 
along with the Contact section are interactive meanwhile the Work and Abilites sections 
are static. Future goals aim to make the stars interactive with more skills to add and to 
add websites that I've created to the Work section to show as experience.
